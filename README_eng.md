## TYT Bio Evren Quiz Application - README.md

### Description
Hello! In this project, I am sharing the "TYT Bio Evren Quiz Application" that I developed using the Python programming language. This application is a quiz application containing various questions from TYT Biology topics. It is intended for players to test their knowledge in the field of biology.

### The basic logic of the application
1) The player clicks on one of the options on the screen and selects their answer.
2) If the selected answer is correct, the player receives feedback related to the correct answer.
3) If the selected answer is incorrect, the player receives feedback related to the incorrect answer and the correct answer is shown.
4) When the player completes all questions, the number of correct and incorrect answers and the total percentage success score are displayed.

### Requirements to run the application
1) Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your computer.
2) Download all files from this project to your computer and keep them in the same folder.
3) Go to the folder where the project is located using the terminal or command line.
4) Start the application using the `py main.py` command or double-clicking main.exe.
